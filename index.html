            During archaeological <br> excavations in Tunnel <br> 3-80-7, discovered deep <br> within the former office <br> complex of the General <br> Agency for Inertnobesafety <br> Assimilation, an unusual <br> face cast was found, made <br> from an unidentified <br> material. The remains were <br> found about 3 meters off <br> the ground in one of the <br>darkened corridors, <br> suggesting the object <br> was placed in the wall <br> for long-term observation.

        <div class="text-block2">
            The cast, judging <br> by its expression, <br> was left at a mo- <br>ment of extreme <br> psychological <br> influence - <br> perhaps this man <br>was caught in the <br> radio waves <br>emitted by the <br>worm Luminaria, <br>or he found him- <br>self in the zone <br>of some psychoac- <br>tive influence <br> that left him <br>no chance <br>of resistance
        </div>
        <div class="text-block3">
            Looking at this face,<br> one can assume that it <br> expresses not just the <br> emotions of one person, <br> but is a symbol of the <br> suffering that all of <br>Luminaria's <br>"subordinates" endured.
